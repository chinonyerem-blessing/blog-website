            <p class="tw">Creating a Landing Page That<br /> Performs Great</p>
            <p class="ne">A short description explaining it in more detail so it isn't out of the blue</p>
            <img class="fr" src="wall 2.jpeg" />
            <p class="ne">Essentially, a landing page is any webpage a visitor lands on after clicking on an ad or a link. It could
                be your homepage, another page<br /> on your website, or a standalone page created for a specific offer,
                product, or campaign.

                The goal of building a landing page is to compel<br /> a visitor to take action—whether it’s to make a
                purchase, join a webinar, or give you their information for email marketing. It’s important<br /> that each
                landing page has a single purpose to help guide users toward the action you want them to take and
                generate higher conversion<br /> rates.<br /><br /><br />

               <span class="hh" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">3 ways a landing page can help your <br />business:<br /><br /></span> 

                It has a better chance to rank in search results. When you craft your landing page using keywords and
                promote it through paid ads, the<br /> combined effect can move your landing page to rank high on search
                engine results pages (SERPs). This gets your promotion or offers <br />in front of a broader set of potential
                customers.
                It can be targeted to launch a specific product, offer, or campaign. Since a landing page<br /> is the first
                page users land on when clicking a link, you can use it for any specific goal you have in mind. You can
                use  landing page<br /> to launch a single product or a marketing campaign, all of which allow you to track
                conversion and sales of a particular product or the<br /> performance of a marketing campaign.
                It makes lead generation or conversion more efficient. If you design your landing page right, it<br /> can
                help deliver the results whether your visitors are at the top of the marketing funnel or at the bottom.
                An effective landing page can<br /> compel more people to become subscribers or click “buy.”
