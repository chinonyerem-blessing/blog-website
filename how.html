            <p class="tw">How Can Designers Prepare For <br />The Future?</p>
            <p>A short description explaining it in more detail so it isn't out of the blue</p>
            <img class="fr" src="wall 3.jpeg" />
            <p class="he">
                As designers, we’re tasked with creating products and experiences that not only meet the needs of today
                but <br />also anticipate the demands of tomorrow. But how do we design for a future that’s always just out of
                reach? <br />To stay ahead of the curve, we don’t have to be able to predict the future, but we do have to
                embrace uncertainty <br />and cultivate a mindset of adaptability.<br /><br />

                When I first started my career as a designer, I thought I had a good grasp on what the future held and<br />
                how to prepare for it. Master the right tools and techniques, and you’ll create successful, future-proof<br />
                designs—or so I believed. But as the years went by and the industry continued to evolve at a rapid<br /> pace,
                I realized my approach was flawed. There will always be factors outside of your control that can
                drastically<br /> alter your environment, leaving you to adapt quickly.<br /><br />

                Throughout my career, I’ve encountered numerous unexpected challenges that have taught me the importance
                of planning<br /> for change. For instance, I once worked on a project where we were set to launch a new
                product only to have a competitor<br /> release a similar offering just days before our planne debut. In
                another case, a change in government regulations<br /> unexpectedly blocked a planned acquisition. These
                experiences have shown me that while you can’t predict exactly <br />what will change, you can anticipate that
                change is inevitable.<br /><br />

                Over time, I’ve established a product framework that outlines three key strategies for planning and
                designing <br />for future changes. By embracing uncertainty and focusing on adaptability, we can create
                designs that not only meet the<br /> needs of today but also thrive in the face of tomorrow’s challenges.<br /><br />

               <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Prioritize goals over solutions<br/></span> 
                Future-proofing your designs isn’t about having a crystal ball. It’s about focusing on the core goals
                that drive your users’ needs. History is<br /> filled with examples of companies that failed to adapt. Take,
                for example, film photography behemoth Kodak and its<br /> reluctance to embrace digital photography. Here was
                a company that dominated the industry for decades but got so <br />caught up fixating on film as the solution
                that it failed to recognize its customers’ primary goal was preserving<br /> memories, not the medium itself.

                It’s a classic case of prioritizing the solution over the goal. At the end of the day,<br /> people just
                wanted to capture and share their memories; the medium was secondary. Don’t over-index on one specific<br />
                solution. When the environment changes, you should question whether the solutions you have still align
                with your<br /> long-term goals, or if they’ve become counterproductive.
