            <p class="tw">Buliding a Navigation Component <br />With Variation</p>
            <p>A short description explaining it in more detail so it isn't out of the blue</p>
            <img class="fr" src="wall 4.jpeg" />
            <p class="nz">Navigation is key within any digital interface. Smart Components enable us to create custom interactive
                navigation,<br /> components that work perfectly with the rest of your prototype.In this guide, we will cover
                the concepts of nesting<br /> components, adding events to elements in a component using Event Variables, and
                passing these through your<br > components.

                One of the main benefits of using nested components is that it provides full control over its states,
                such<br /> as unique hover states of elements within another component.<br /><br />



               <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Starting at the atomic level</span> <br />
                Framer allows you to create fully interactive and animated components, and even allows you to nest
                components within<br /> other components.

                We’re building a navigation bar component for a website that will contain two different kinds of nested<br />
                components, with their own unique interactions. Our project will contain a Navigation bar that contains
                various nested<br /> components, namely five Nav items and one Shopping cart component.

                The design of our nested components, the nav list<br /> item and the shopping cart, will impact how we design
                our navigation bar. For this reason, an optimal workflow includes<br /> starting with the 'deepest' nested
                component and building up from there.<br /><br />



               <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Nesting components</span> <br />
                Once we have our two components ready, we can start creating the component in which we will nest these.
                Draw your<br /> navigation bar, select it on the canvas and click the Component tool in the Toolbar.

                To nest a different component in our<br /> new component, just drag any other component to the Component
                Canvas and place it within your designed navigation bar.<br /><br />



                <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Triggering interactions from the navigation bar</span><br />
                Back on the main canvas, we’d like to be able to tap 'Clothing' and navigate to an entire new Screen. If
                you’d connect<br /> the component using the Prototyping Connector to a new screen, we could set up an
                Interaction. However, this would be<br /> triggered if we tap anywhere within our component.

                This isn’t what we want to do, as we want to trigger this transition only<br /> from a specific element. This
                is where Event Variables come in, which are special types of Variables not attached to properties<br /> (like
                opacity or fill) but instead to events.<br /><br />



                <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">When we say fast, what do we really mean?</span><br />
                When we talk about a fast canvas or fast computer in general, there are three parts that we mean. First,
                the time it takes things<br /> to load. For example, the time it takes for the app to load or for a specific
                page or document to load before you can see it and<br /> start working. Second, the time it takes to draw
                (every frame), determining how smooth scrolling and animations are. And finally,<br /> the time it takes
                something to respond to your actions, in other words, the latency or lag you feel—or don’t feel.Just
                like the makers <br />of any other tool, we use these measurements to assess Framer’s performance.</p>
